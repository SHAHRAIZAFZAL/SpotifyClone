# SpotifyClone
HTML/CSS/JS

Spotify Clone is a web-based music player that dynamically fetches and plays songs from a local server. Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project retrieves available MP3 files, displays them in a user-friendly playlist, and allows seamless playback. It features real-time song loading, intuitive UI components, and event-driven interactions for a smooth user experience. With fetch API, DOM manipulation, and audio handling, this project mimics basic functionalities of a music streaming app. Future enhancements may include a search feature, playlists, and improved UI/UX for a more interactive experience. ðŸš€ðŸŽ¶
